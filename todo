Note: for now you can exclude one module from being loaded by setting LOAD_<module_name>=0 in .bashrc 
however, in the future, I might plan to exclude some modules from being installed. 
In this case, the LOAD_<module_name> should be defined the utils/env.sh and therefore be accessed also by any module, which can prevent installation from starting the variable is not 1. In env.sh you can also introduce other variable for specific submodules LOAD_<submodule_name>, which could be excluded as well from PATH and installations.

- in order to work locally, alias python3 should be created linking to pyenv

Refactoring:
    - base should be called base-env 
    - envs should be call toolchain
    - repoenvs should be called... ???
